# IoT-Based-Smart-Garbage-Monitoring-System
The IoT-Based Smart Garbage Monitoring System monitors garbage levels using an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino. When the bin becomes full, alerts are sent through WiFi to a cloud platform. This system reduces overflow, saves resources, and improves waste management efficiency in smart cities.
# IoT-Based Smart Garbage Monitoring System

## 📌 Overview
This project monitors the garbage level in bins using an ultrasonic sensor.
When the bin is almost full, the system sends an alert to the user through
an IoT platform using WiFi.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time garbage level monitoring
- Mobile alert using IoT
- Reduces overflow and improves cleanliness
- Smart city application

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- ESP8266 WiFi Module
- Buzzer / LED
- Power Supply

## 📡 Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance between the sensor and garbage.
If the distance is below a set threshold, the bin is considered FULL.
Data is sent to the cloud using WiFi.

## 🌍 Applications
- Smart Cities
- Municipal Waste Management
- Public Places (Bus stand, railway station)
