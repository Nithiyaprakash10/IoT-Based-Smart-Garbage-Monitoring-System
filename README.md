# IoT-Based-Smart-Garbage-Monitoring-System
The IoT-Based Smart Garbage Monitoring System monitors garbage levels using an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino. When the bin becomes full, alerts are sent through WiFi to a cloud platform. This system reduces overflow, saves resources, and improves waste management efficiency in smart cities.
